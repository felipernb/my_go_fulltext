My Go Full Text Index
====================

After a couple of hours reading, learning and coding Go, I've came up with this project
with some simple lines of code to implement a full text search engine.

The code might not be as good as it could be but it's just a didatic project to learn the basics of Go.

The indexer binary is complied to OSX amd64, and to run you just need to pass as parameters the text files you want to be indexed

e.g.: $ indexer fileA.txt fileB.txt fileC.txt
